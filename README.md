# Gesture Project - Myo Armband - Drone

The Myo armband is a gesture controller that triggers a variety of actions on the computer based on the contractions of your muscles and the movements of your arm. It is intended for a variety of applications like controlling a slideshow presentation, controlling video playback while you're AFK, gaming, and more. We couldn't help but peek inside to take a closer look at how this interesting design was put together.
